# arachno_bob
This is an attempt at creating an irc bot for personal use, mainly for learning purposes.  
It is made for linux using modern cpp; there will be no portability.  
  
STL libs are used wherever possible. For connections socket.h and associated libraries are used.  
The aim is to have it be modular, and maybe have some cool stuff like markov chains and google searches etc..
